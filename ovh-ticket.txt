Subject: VPS stuck in rescue mode - cannot reboot or reinstall

VPS: vps-ec36a417.vps.ovh.net
IP: 141.227.152.143

My VPS has been stuck in rescue mode for 2 days. I cannot:
- Reboot the server
- Switch boot mode from RESCUE to HARD DISK
- Reinstall the OS

Every action shows error: "Action not available while there are running tasks on the VPS"

There are no tasks running on my side. Please force stop/reboot the VPS or clear whatever is blocking it.

Thank you.
