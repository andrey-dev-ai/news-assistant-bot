Subject: VPS Stuck in Rescue Mode - Unable to Reboot or Access Normal System

Dear OVH Support Team,

I am experiencing critical issues with my VPS (vps-ec36a417.vps.ovh.net, IP: 141.227.152.143) and urgently need assistance.

**Problem Description:**
My VPS is stuck in rescue mode and I cannot boot it into normal mode or access the system with my credentials.

**What I've tried:**
1. Changed root password via rescue mode using chroot
2. Attempted to switch Boot mode from RESCUE to HARD DISK in the control panel
3. Tried to reboot the VPS multiple times
4. Used force reboot commands (reboot -f, sync)
5. Waited for system to fully restart

**Current Issues:**
- VPS remains stuck in rescue mode after every reboot
- Control panel shows error: "Action not available while there are running tasks on the VPS" when trying to reboot
- Cannot change boot mode from RESCUE to normal boot
- New password set in rescue mode doesn't work when VPS boots normally
- VPS appears to have background tasks running that prevent any operations

**What I need:**
- Force the VPS out of rescue mode and into normal boot mode
- OR completely reinstall the VPS with Ubuntu 22.04 or 24.04 LTS (I have backups of all data)
- Ensure the VPS can boot normally and accept SSH connections with root credentials

**VPS Details:**
- Server: vps-ec36a417.vps.ovh.net
- IP: 141.227.152.143
- Current OS: Ubuntu 25.04
- Model: VPS-1
- Location: Amsterdam

This issue has been ongoing for several hours and is blocking critical work. I would appreciate urgent assistance to resolve this.

Thank you for your help.

Best regards
